# Give it away! - ending project for CodersLab.
_Current project that i am working on._

This Spring Boot application is for users who want to give away old stuff that they are not using anymore. The idea is to give users a tool to get rid of things for free. To trade with other users you need to be logged in. You dont have to be logged in to check available items.
